FileManager
===========

A File Management System with profiles and private groups. The system also comes with an admin access and a back-up system. Technology used is PHP for back-end and HTML/CSS for front-end.

This project is created in MySQL deprecated form. It is also no longer maintained. There is no service providor (RESTful API) that deals wtih the server requests, so each script performs a functionality and returns the response to the user. 

The highlight of this project was to implement a working prototype according to a pre-defined documentation. In other words, the main purpose of this was to reflect the functional and non-functional requirements in the document. 

**The document will be uploaded soon**
